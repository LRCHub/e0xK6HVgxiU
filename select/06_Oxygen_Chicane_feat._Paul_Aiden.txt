You're all I wanted
And I tried hard not to let you down
And I hope you feel it
Cause I can't see

If you're feeling lonely, yeah
And you need someone to calm you down
I could be around now
Anytime, just come to me

I know sometimes
We're caught in the lights
I feel it sinking in
Lets start right now, I couldn't say goodbye
I wanna start over again.
You're my Oxygen

If you're feeling lonely, yeah
And you need someone to calm you down
I could be around now
Anytime just come to me

Can you hear me calling you back home?
When you're all alone
Can you hear me calling?
Anytime, just come to me
