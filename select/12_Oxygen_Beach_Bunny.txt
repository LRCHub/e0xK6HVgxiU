Back me out of this mess, I can't help from
Constantly hiding all the feelings I'm finding within
Word's out on the carpet, and everybody's watching me
Wait for the pitfall, hit my face on a brick wall

They don't wanna see you the way I do
But life looks better through my worldview

Suddenly, everything is easy
I've never felt something so deeply
'Cause with you, with you, I breathe again
Baby, you're my oxygen, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Help me out of this place, I'm stuck inside a wave
Of confusion over what's the solution with my life
Mostly, I'm okay with having a few bad days
Locked in my bedroom with my heart out on display

But they don't want to view you the way I do
And life looks better when it's with you

Suddenly, everything is easy
I've never felt something so deeply
'Cause with you, with you, I breathe again
Baby, you're my oxygen, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Suddenly, everything is easy
I've never felt something so deeply
'Cause with you, with you, I breathe again
Baby, you're my oxygen
Oh-oh, baby, you're my oxygen, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
