I take each breath
As if it is my first
I hold it there so deep inside me
Until I'm 'bout to burst
I speak each word as if it is your name
I move my lips and taste the moment
But still it sounds the same

Your hand moves and so does mine
Our eyes meet
And I know I"m alive

You are my oxygen
I breath you in, I breath you out
You are my oxygen
You are my love, you are what life's about

I take each breath
As if it is my last
You never know, what came so slow
Could leave us oh so fast
I take each step as if it is to you
I hear your voice, I feel your presence
In everything I do

My body sleeps, your lips revive
Our hearts beat
And I know I'm alive

You are my oxygen
I breath you in, I breath you out
You are my oxygen
You are my love, you are what life's about

I'm nobody without you
If you were not here, what would I do?
You are my oxygen
I breath you in, I breath you out
You are my oxygen
You are my love, you are what life's about
